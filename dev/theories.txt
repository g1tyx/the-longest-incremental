These theories aren't supposed to be "planned."

------------------------------------ Aarex: Crescent Layer ------------------------------------
So, I'm bored... Here are my theories for Layer 5.
  1. Corrupt: Well, the Bug minigame is planned to have corruption. How about we take corruption one step further?
  2. Colonize: Since Earth will be a self-extendible feature, maybe we could put Layer 5 here with new Earth subfeatures.
  3. Crescent: Same thing as Colonize, but how about we expand Earth with space stuff?
