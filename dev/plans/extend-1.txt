------------------------------------ *** EXTEND 1 *** ------------------------------------
- (Meta) Extend (L∞)
  * This layer underpins all others, with heavily scaled requirements.
  * Extending resets EVERYTHING except the Extend layer itself. 
  * Each reset unlocks a new layer, expands all layers, and unlocks some boosts to speed up the early game.
    * And yes, I do mean expand ALL layers. All the way from layer 0 to the most recently unlocked one.
  * Unlocked at the end of the Bug minigame.

  * (Consensus) Also, there's perks. You can choose one more Perk per Layer than last Extend.
  ** Layer 0 perks unlock at Extend 1 and Layer X perks unlock at Extend X.
  ** There's also "keep X" perks too!
  ** These do not subtract from other perks.

------------------------------------ MINIGAMES ------------------------------------
Minigames:
  - Minigames are unlocked as a feature of L4. (except for bugs, those are unlocked earlier)
  - Bugs unlock at the end of L3, and others unlock at Ascension.

  - This will have its own tab.
  - Minigames boost pre-Ascension and Ascension.

  - NOTICE: THERE ARE TOO MANY MINIGAMES.
  - We will only consider some to implement.

1. (by incremental_gamer) tetrational power tower game (basically base^^height)
  no, this is not inflation
  1.44^^Infinity = some real number
2. (Aarex's) tetrational balancing (basically multiple dilated formulas stacked on one, and are upgraded by a single currency. +1 slog^0.75 -> x2 tetr points)
3. (Aarex's) Lights out!
  You are a snake in a grid.
  There's lights you need to collect.
  There are different kinds of lights.
∞. (Consensus) Bugs (unlocked at: end of L3 pre-extend, end of L4 post-extend, beat at least 1 minigame (increases by 1 per extend))
  - Unlike other minigames, this is not ranked.
  * (incremental_gamer) you gain bugs (side effect of features), anti-bugs, and features
  * you can reset features for updates
  * updates for games, games for money, and then spend it
  * however, you can increase your bug and anti-bugs gain
  * then your bug gain will explode and that's how the corruption is gotten
  - After E1, progress in this minigame will depend partially on progress in other minigames.
  - There's an ominous progress bar that has the caption "n% to Corruption"
  - The screen gets more and more "glitched" as the minigame progresses.

  - When the percentage reaches 100%, the Extend meta-layer is unlocked.
  - After at least 1 Extend reset, the caption changes to "n% to next Extension"
  - Animation was chosen in #gameplay-discussion.
4. (incremental_gamer) The Longest Incremental Minigame
  - basically you are a dev that is trying to create a game
  - release versions, fix bugs, and balance stuff
  - can be slightly boosted based on progress in the real game
  - maybe a prestige layer...?
Not considered:
1. (incremental_gamer) incremental version game
  Empty yet.
2. (randomtuba) replicanti 
  Empty yet.
3. (downvoid) Code Editor thing
  (Aarex) Just like Rune Sequences but harder.
  (downvoid) I don't even know how this would work.

Non-acceptable minigames:
1. (randomtuba) gwacremental (gwa comes every minute) 
  "wait what, we're actually adding the entirety of gwacremental as a minigame?" -downvoid
  (incremental_gamer) dumb question but what is gwacremental
  (Aarex's) Too complicated if we copy the whole game.
  (downvoid) I guess we could add --nevermind, that won't work.
2. (meta) lightning (type every dev's names as fast as possible)
  Typing isn't an aspect for incremental games.
3. (Aarex's) balancing control (a game which automatically reduces / adds numbers. going out of bounds loses.)
  Minigames are now a feature. Therefore, I don't allow this reflexing game.
4. (incremental_gamer) Recursion minigame.
  Point gain recursively multiplies itself.
  However, when you reach B_E limit, you can reset to log10 your gain but unlock new features (maybe for other games) (kinda like despacit tree and tetration)
  (downvoid) isn't this just the *exact* same thing as Inflation Tree Plus
  (downvoid) like when you reach Fe308 in the Inflation Tree Plus, you get to reset everything and log10 your point gain and add more layers/features/upgrades
  (incremental_gamer) yes but also i was thinking about prestreestuck and it's final layer
  we could borrow ideas from there
  (Aarex) Woah, woah. This breaks the purpose of Extend.

------------------------------------ Layer 0 ------------------------------------
- More point upgrades. It's really simple.
- 10 points: start with 1e5 points on booster/darken reset
-- balancing check: immediately get boosters and enhancements with that.

------------------------------------ Layer 1 ------------------------------------
- (randomtuba) AUGMENTATION (EXTEND 1)
  * You can now "augment" your boosters to gain augmented boosters (kind of like consumption).
  ** You gain one augment booster per 1 booster.
  * Augmented boosters allow you to augment point upgrades, like how regular boosters allow you to enhance buildings.
  * Augmented upgrades have improved effects.
    -- Upgrade 1: Effect ^2
    -- Upgrade 2: Effect ^1.5 (cost inflation + softcap)
    -- Upgrade 3: Unlock super-boosters? (scales quadratically, boosts dark energy)
    -- Upgrade 4: Upgrade 2 has an even better formula.
    -- Upgrade 5: Makers produce more points based on Makers bought.
    -- Upgrade 6: All building production is multiplied by your total amount of boosters.
    -- Upgrade 7: Effect ^2
  * (Aarex) Might be Enhancements / Building Boosters, but to Point Upgrades instead.
    - Oh, you'll keep Augmentation in Lighten Mode.

- (downvoid) Super Boosters (Augmentation, Upgrade 3)
 * Super boosters increase the booster base.
 ** Adds effective Boosters instead if Boosters don't scale.
 * They can also be enhanced.
 * They will also have milestones that give even more QoL to the layers.

------------------------------------ Layer 2 ------------------------------------
Do not add Post-Extend features in Layer 2.
The layer is now finally completed for features.

From the owner of Darken:
- Hey, zappies!
- The layer is now finally completed.
- No post-extend L2 features will be accepted.

For each Extend, you'll be given a new Recall Factor with a proficent resource.
- Thus, alloying with that resource will unlock new powerful resources.

Anyways, Aarex / Lightning's out!

So, new Recall resources, anyone? -Meta

------------------------------------ Layer 3 ------------------------------------
Yes. 4 more features to come.
They're either unlocked by extending or unlock new features from Ascension.
New features come from the second Upgrade Tree.

- (meta) Energy/Matter:
there is a button to convert your points to energy and matter
there's also a bar you can use to control how much energy and matter you get upon conversion
additionally, you don't retain your PREVIOUS energy/matter upon conversion
- (???) Mana:
  * ???
- (???) Blood:
  * ???

------------------------------------ Layer 4 ------------------------------------
- ASCENSION (L4):
  * Basically ascension from trollcremental
  -- ASCENSION UPGRADES:
  Ascension Points can be used to buy Ascension Upgrades, and some of them can be charged with AP to have a greater impact (the ones with effects)
  -- TECHNOBABBLE GAMING:
  Based on your total AP, you generate Technobabble Gaming (TG), which pisses off scientists based on how many you have, which raises some ascension upgrade effects
  Pissed off scientists also unlock milestones (some have QoL, some unlock new mechanics)
    --- QUARK-GLUON:
    There are two currencies, quark-gluon plasma and quark-gluon gas. You can use the thermocharger to generate more/less of the two currencies.
    Quark-gluon plasma generates at higher temperature and boosts TG, quark-gluon gas generates at lower temperature and boosts main L4 currency gain
    --- SECONDARY PARTICLES:
    Based on your pissed off scientists, you generate Higgs fermions that boost quark-gluon effects
    You can also change the type of photons you have (6 types, up, down, top, bottom, charm, strange), each having different effects
    UP: boosts AP gain
    DOWN: raises point gain
    TOP: boosts higgs fermion gain
    BOTTOM: boosts TG gain
    CHARM: boosts quark-gluon gains
    STRANGE: boosts photon gain
  -- ASCENSION CHALLENGES:
  There are 8 Ascension Challenges. They can be completed up to TEN TIMES.
  Each first-time completion of an Ascension Challenge should unlock something significant.
  -- GIFTS:
  After unlocking this mechanic from an Ascension Upgrade, you can also gain giftboxes from Ascending!
  Giftboxes can be sacrificed to different developers, each one having a different effect.
  (downvoid) Gifts will boost or unlock new features in branches of the upgrade tree and elements.
