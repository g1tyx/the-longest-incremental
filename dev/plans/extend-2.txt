------------------------------------ *** EXTEND 2 *** ------------------------------------
- (Meta) Extend (Lâˆž)
  * This layer underpins all others, with heavily scaled requirements.
  * Extending resets EVERYTHING except the Extend layer itself. 
  * Each reset unlocks a new layer, expands all layers, and unlocks some boosts to speed up the early game.
    * And yes, I do mean expand ALL layers. All the way from layer 0 to the most recently unlocked one.
  * Unlocked at the end of the Bug minigame.

  * (Consensus) Also, there's perks. You can choose one more Perk per Layer than last Extend.
  ** Layer 0 perks unlock at Extend 1 and Layer X perks unlock at Extend X.
  ** There's also "keep X" perks too!
  ** These do not subtract from other perks.

DO NOT PLAN HERE. (yet, until we are done with E1)
